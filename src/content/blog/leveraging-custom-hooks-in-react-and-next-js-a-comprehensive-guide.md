## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of a custom hook called `useLocalStorage` that allows you to persist state to the browser's local storage in React and Next.js:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Custom hook to save state to local storage
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  // Retrieve stored value from local storage, if available
  const storedValue = localStorage.getItem(key);
  // Parse stored JSON or if none return initialValue
  const initial = storedValue ? JSON.parse(storedValue) : initialValue;

  // State to store the value
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initial);

  // Update local storage when state changes
  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  }, [key, value]);

  return [value, setValue];
}

export default useLocalStorage;
```

How to use the `useLocalStorage` hook:

1. Import the hook:

```javascript
import useLocalStorage from './useLocalStorage';
```

2. Using the hook in a component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  // Usage of the useLocalStorage hook
  const [name, setName] = useLocalStorage('username', '');

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter your name"
      />
      <p>Hello, {name || 'stranger'}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, the `useLocalStorage` hook accepts two parameters: the `key` under which the value will be stored in local storage and the `initialValue` that will be used if no value exists in local storage for that key. It returns an array with two elements: the current value and a function to update the value.

By using this custom hook, you can easily persist state across page reloads or even across different sessions, enhancing the user experience in your React and Next.js applications.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. May your code always be clean, your applications performant, and your creativity boundless. Until next time, happy coding! ðŸš€âœ¨
