## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of software development, creating efficient and responsive applications often involves integrating multiple technologies. One powerful combination is using React Native for the front end and FastAPI for the back end. This blog will guide you through the process of connecting these two technologies, sharing practical tips and solutions to common issues. Along the way, we’ll dive into some stories to keep things engaging.

## Table of contents

## The Power of React Native and FastAPI

React Native is a popular framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to write code once and run it on both iOS and Android devices. On the other hand, FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

Together, React Native and FastAPI provide a powerful combination for developing robust, scalable, and high-performance applications.

## The Relay Race of Development

Imagine software development as a relay race, where each technology represents a relay stick. Just like in a relay race, seamless handover between technologies is crucial for success. In our case, React Native and FastAPI need to pass data back and forth smoothly to ensure a fast and reliable user experience.

## Installing FastAPI:

```bash
python -m pip install fastapi
```

## Installing Uvicorn

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

```bash
# Run the server using:
uvicorn myapi:app --reload

# This will run on: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

# API docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
# API redocs : http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
```

## The Handoff: Setting Up FastAPI

First, let’s set up a simple FastAPI server. Here’s the code for a basic FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allows all origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allows all methods
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allows all headers
)

@app.get('/')
def index():
    return {"name": "First Data"}
```

In this setup, we’ve added CORS middleware to allow requests from any origin, which is crucial for development environments where your front end and back end might be running on different ports or domains.

## The Handoff: Connecting React Native

Now, let’s move to the React Native side. We’ll create a simple component that fetches data from our FastAPI server.

```typescript
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const callApi = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(`http://10.0.2.2:8000`, {
          method: "GET",
        });

        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }

        const responseData = await response.json();
        setData(responseData);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
        console.log("Network request failed: ", err);
      }
    };

    callApi();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>App</Text>
      {data ? <Text>{JSON.stringify(data)}</Text> : <Text>Loading...</Text>}
      {error && <Text>Error: {error}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Handling Common Issues

### Network Request Failed

One common error developers face is `TypeError: Network request failed`. This usually occurs due to network issues or incorrect URL configurations. Here are some tips to troubleshoot this error:

1. **Verify FastAPI Server:** Ensure your FastAPI server is running. You can do this by navigating to your project directory and running `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

2. **Correct URL Configuration:**

- For Android emulator, use `http://10.0.2.2:8000`.
- For a real device, use your computer’s IP address, e.g., `http://192.168.1.14:8000`.

1. **Network Connection:** Ensure both your computer and device are on the same network.
2. **Firewall Settings:** Temporarily disable your firewall to rule out connection issues.

## Expert Tips

- **Use Debugging Tools:** Tools like React Native Debugger or Flipper can help you inspect network requests and identify issues.
- **Ensure Correct IP Address:** Always double-check the IP address and port number to avoid connectivity issues.
- **CORS Configuration:** Properly configure CORS in your FastAPI application to allow cross-origin requests.

## A Story of Persistence

Let’s wrap this up with a little story. Imagine a developer named Alex, who was tasked with building a new mobile application for a fast-growing startup. Alex chose React Native for its cross-platform capabilities and FastAPI for its blazing-fast performance.

However, Alex encountered numerous `Network request failed` errors, leading to many late nights and countless cups of coffee. Determined, Alex followed the steps mentioned above—verifying server status, adjusting network configurations, and debugging meticulously.

In the end, Alex successfully integrated React Native with FastAPI, delivering a smooth and responsive application that impressed the entire team. Alex’s story reminds us that persistence and attention to detail are key in software development.

## Conclusion

Integrating React Native with FastAPI can seem daunting, but with the right approach, it becomes a manageable and rewarding process. By following best practices and troubleshooting common issues, you can ensure a seamless handoff between these powerful technologies, much like runners in a well-coordinated relay race.

Happy coding!
