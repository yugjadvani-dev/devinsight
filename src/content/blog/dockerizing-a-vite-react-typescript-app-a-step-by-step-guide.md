In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, efficient and scalable deployment is a must for any developer. Docker offers a seamless way to package and distribute applications, ensuring consistency across environments. In this blog post, we’ll dive into Dockerizing a Vite + React + TypeScript app, breaking down the process step by step. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting, this guide will help you deploy your app with confidence.

## Step 1: Create Your Vite App

First things first, let’s set up our Vite project. Vite is a fast, opinionated web development build tool that serves as a great alternative to more traditional setups like Create React App.

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Navigate to your newly created project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd my-vite-app
npm install
```

## Step 2: Verify Your Build

Before we dive into Docker, it’s crucial to ensure that your build process completes successfully. You can test this locally with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

If everything compiles without errors, you’re good to go.

## Step 3: Update Your Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is the heart of your Docker setup. It defines the environment in which your application runs. Here’s a streamlined version to ensure your Vite app runs smoothly within a Docker container:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Remove node_modules and package-lock.json if they exist
RUN rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the Vite project
RUN npm run build

# Install serve to serve static files
RUN npm install -g serve

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Serve the built files
CMD ["serve", "-s", "dist"]
```

## Step 4: Create a .dockerignore File

To optimize the Docker build process, create a `.dockerignore` file. This will prevent unnecessary files from being included in your Docker image, reducing its size and improving build times.

```bash
node_modules
dist
```

## Step 5: Rebuild and Run the Docker Container

With everything set up, it’s time to build and run your Docker container. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
docker build -t my-vite-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-vite-app
```

## Step 6: Verify Local Setup

Head over to your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. If all went well, you should see your Vite + React + TypeScript app up and running. Congratulations, your app is now Dockerized!

## Optional: Using Docker Compose

For those managing multiple services or looking for an easier way to manage your Docker configuration, Docker Compose is a great tool. Here’s a sample `docker-compose.yml` file to get you started:

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
```

Start your services with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Conclusion

Dockerizing your Vite + React + TypeScript app might seem daunting at first, but by following these steps, you can achieve a consistent, scalable deployment setup. Not only does this approach streamline your development workflow, but it also ensures that your application runs smoothly across different environments.

Happy coding, and may your containers always run smoothly!
