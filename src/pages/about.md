## About DevInsight

Welcome to **DevInsight**, a minimal, responsive, and SEO-friendly blog platform that I've crafted specifically for developers. DevInsight is not just another templateâ€”it's a project built from the ground up to meet the needs of the modern developer.

This blog is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that content is available to everyone. It supports both light and dark modes by default, with the flexibility to add additional color schemes as desired.

### Why DevInsight?

I created DevInsight to share my knowledge, insights, and experiences with the developer community. Every aspect of this blog, from the design to the code, reflects my personal journey and dedication to providing valuable content to fellow developers.
